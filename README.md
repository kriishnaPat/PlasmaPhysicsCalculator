## PlasmaPhysicsResearchProject

I was chosen as one of 39 students from across Canada to participate in the program. My research placement was in the Computer and Electrical Engineering faculty under Dr.Jason Myatt. I utilized Python and object-oriented programming to create a plasma physics program, that organized plasma formulary in a way that could be easily extended and edited as research is further developed. 
In addition, my program is now used by researchers as well as students in the plasma physics field. At the end of my placement I also published a [research paper](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/9152948a-175b-48fd-b790-a1170f4634c0) outlining the procedures and methods used for the program to the Education & Research Archive (ERA).
